                      BASIC NEEDS AND KNOW HOW....


YARNS: Yarns vary in size, twist and texture. Use the “Dawn” Yarn
indicated in the directions as only an experienced expert knitter knows
how to allow for the difference when a substitution is made. It is also
very important to purchase all the yarn needed at one time as different
dye lots frequently have different shades of color.

When you purchase your yarn always check the dye lot number to make
certain they are all the same. It is much wiser to purchase a little
extra yarn than to try and match the dye lot after your garment is
finished. Though the color may look the same in the skein more often
than not the difference will be seen in the finished work. The “ply” of
yarn means the number of strands twisted together. This can be seen by
taking the end of the yarn and untwisting.


                        FUNDAMENTALS & SOME TIPS

Learn the basic stitches. There are only three: Knit, Purl and slip. All
the others are produced by variations and in combination with yarn
overs. See page 10.

Practice first with heavy yarn and thick needles. Study the stitch and
the position it takes on the needle. Follow arrows in illustration.
Learn to recognize when it is wrong. Watch the yarn to see where each
loop of the stitch begins and ends. If you lay your knitting aside for a
few days or longer, always rip back a few rows before starting again.
This will prevent an uneven row. See page 12 for ripping back.

Parentheses in our instructions are used for an explanation of a st, a
certain section of a garment, or change of sts for change of size. A ROW
is once across the needle. A RIDGE is 2 rows, back and forth. WORK EVEN,
means to continue in pattern st keeping the continuity of the design.

Always MEASURE straight up and down unless otherwise stated.


                              WINDING WOOL

Winding the wool correctly is important. Never wind wool tightly as this
stretches it. Wind several strands around fingers, slip these from
fingers. Over these strands, in opposite direction, wind a few more
strands wrapping yarn around fingers and ball. Continue in this manner,
always winding over fingers and in opposite direction from last winding.

LEFT HAND KNITTING: Follow the instructions but change your copy to read
left hand where it says “right hand” and vice versa. Use a mirror to
study diagrams and charts. This will reverse the image for you.

JOINING YARNS ... If possible, join the new yarn with a knot at the
beginning of a row. If this cannot be done, work next st with new yarn
leaving a 4 inch length. Work a few sts, tie the ends firmly and with a
yarn needle weave ends into work.

MARKER ... This term is used whenever it is important that a certain
point is to be marked. Example: increase, decrease, beginning of a row
or round, buttonholes, center st, etc. To make a marker of yarn, use a
different color; make a slip knot leaving ends about 2 inches in length.
Place on needle as directed. Slip marker off one needle to the other
needle in each successive round.

MULTIPLE OF STS ... This term is used generally at beginning of
directions and means that a certain multiple of sts is necessary to work
one pattern. Example: multiple of 4 sts would mean any number divisible
by 4 or 12, 16, 24 sts, etc. A multiple of 4 plus 2 would be 14, 18, 26
sts, etc., or any number that has 2 more sts after dividing by 4.


                              NEEDLE TYPES

STRAIGHT NEEDLES ... are used when working back and forth in rows. They
come in lengths of 10, 12, and 14 inches and sizes O-1-2-3, etc. The
larger the number, the thicker the needle.

DOUBLE POINTED NEEDLES ... come in sets of 4 or 5. They are used for
socks, mittens and any articles made in rounds.

CIRCULAR NEEDLES ... are used in making skirts, or parts of garments
when a seam is not desired; also in completing a large doily or a round
tablecloth.

Directions give the size and type needle required and it is not
advisable to change the size unless it is necessary in order to obtain
the correct gauge.

CABLE NEEDLES ... are short with a bend in the center to hold sts from
slipping off. They are available in thin or thick size for the different
yarns. A short double pointed needle may also be used. It is a good idea
after placing sts on the straight needle to be used for cable to stick
needle into garment slightly, this will prevent sts from slipping off
needle.

STITCH HOLDERS ... are used to hold sts to be used later. Example: sts
at back of neck or when all sts are cast on and worked to armholes, then
divided for front and back. The stitch holders can be purchased or a
safety pin or length of yarn may be used.

STITCH COUNTERS ... usually placed on knitting needles. They have a dial
and after working a row, turn the dial to the next number.

BOBBINS ... usually made of plastic to hold small amounts of yarn for
use in making argyle socks or the Fair Isle, Scandinavian or Ski
patterns.

GAUGE ... The stitch gauge which appears at the beginning of all
instructions is most important to the size and fit of your garment.
Before starting, make a sample swatch of the pattern stitch with the
needles and yarn specified. If you have MORE sts than gauge use LARGER
needles. If you have LESS sts than gauge use SMALLER needles. Check your
gauge as you progress to assure a perfectly sized garment, Ill. No. 1.

    [Illustration: 1]


                               CASTING ON

Allow about ½ inch for each st for fine yarn and 1 inch for each st for
heavy yarn. Make a slip knot on needle, Ill. No. 2. * Hold needle in
right hand, hold both lengths of yarn in left hand (see arrows) having
short end of yarn under and to outside of thumb and main length of yarn
under and to outside of forefinger, Ill. No. 3. Insert needle through
loop formed on thumb, pick up yarn on forefinger and draw through loop,
Ill. No. 4, let loop drop from thumb and tighten st on right needle with
thumb. Repeat from * leaving about ¼ inch between sts until required
number of sts have been cast on, Ill. No. 5.

    [Illustration: 5]


                             PLAIN KNITTING

Hold needle containing stitches in left hand. Follow arrows. * With yarn
in back of work, insert free needle from left to right in front of st,
yarn under and over point of needle and draw through st, slip stitch
just worked from left needle. Retain new stitch on right needle. Repeat
from * until all stitches are on right needle. 2nd Row and Succeeding
Rows: Place the needle holding stitches in left hand with free needle in
right hand. Insert free needle in 1st stitch and complete same as 1st
row.

    [Illustration: 10]


                                PURLING

Hold work same as for Knitting, but hold yarn to front of work. Follow
arrows. * Insert needle from right to left in front of st, yarn around
and in back of point of needle, draw through st having new stitch on
right needle, slip stitch off left needle. Repeat from * until all
stitches are on right needle.

    [Illustration: 13]


                           STOCKINETTE STITCH

Knit 1 row, Purl 1 row when working with 2 needles. K each row when
working with a circular needle or on 3 or 4 double pointed needles.

    [Illustration: 14 Knit Side]

    [Illustration: 15 Purl Side]


                                RIBBING

Ribbing consists of an alternate number of Knit and Purl stitches. In
Knit 2, Purl 2 ribbing the number of stitches cast on is usually
divisible by 4. 1st ROW: K 2, P 2 across row. In the next row again
start with K 2. In ribbing, the smooth sts are knitted, the sts with
rough side are purled. In binding off ribbing Knit the Knit sts and Purl
the Purl stitches.

    [Illustration: 16]


                         TO DECREASE OR NARROW

In Knitting, Knit 2 sts together (Ill. No. 17), in Purling, Purl 2 sts
together.

    [Illustration: 17]


                    PASS SLIP STITCH OVER (P.S.S.O.)

(another method of decreasing).... In knitting instructions p.s.s.o.
means to slip 1 st, K (or P) next st, then pass the slip st over the K
(or P) st by inserting left needle into slip st on right needle and
passing over the K st on right needle. Follow arrows in illustrations.

    [Illustration: 18]

    [Illustration: 19]

    [Illustration: 20]

    [Illustration: 21]


                              TO INCREASE

Knit or Purl 1 st (as directions call for), but do not slip stitch from
left needle (Ill. No. 22 & 23). Knit or Purl into back of same st, then
slip stitch off needle (Ill. No. 24).

Illustration shows a Knit increase.

    [Illustration: 22]

    [Illustration: 23]

    [Illustration: 24]


                             YARN OVER....

Unless otherwise instructed when knitting, bring yarn forward and over
right needle to back, K next st. When Purling bring yarn over and under
right needle and to front, P next st. The yarn over forms a loop on
needle which is worked as a stitch, it is used usually for lacy patterns
and beadings.

    [Illustration: 25 Knit]

    [Illustration: 26 Purl]


                                BIND OFF

Do not bind off too tightly.

Knitting: K 2 sts, * pass the 1st stitch over the 2nd stitch: follow
arrows (Ill. 27, 28, 29), K next st, repeat from * until one stitch
remains on right needle, cut yarn and draw through last st.

PURLING: P 2 sts, * pass 1st stitch over 2nd stitch, P next st, repeat
from * until one stitch remains on right needle, cut yarn and draw
through last st. Not illustrated.

IN PATTERN: Either Knit or Purl st to be bound off as it would have been
worked in corresponding row of pattern, then bind off for knitting or
purling whichever pattern calls for. Not illustrated.

    [Illustration: 28]

    [Illustration: 29]


                          TO SLIP A STITCH....

Slip one st from left needle to right needle without knitting or purling
inserting the right needle in the st as if to Knit unless otherwise
directed. When slipping the stitch leave yarn to the wrong side unless
directed otherwise.


                PICKING UP STITCHES .... DROPPED ST ...

In stockinette stitch pick up stitch on right side of work. Using a
crochet hook, insert hook in dropped st, draw yarn to row above through
loop forming a new loop. Continue in this manner until you reach the row
being worked being careful not to twist the sts. (Ill. No. 30). PURL sts
are picked up by inserting crochet hook through dropped st from in back
of sts. (Ill. No. 31). In GARTER STITCH alternate the two movements.
RIPPING BACK: Unravel work to within the last row of point desired. Rip
the last row a stitch at a time placing each stitch on a free needle,
preferably a finer double pointed needle, then place these sts back on
size needle you are using. Continue knitting as directed.

                        PICKING UP STITCHES ...

around neck and armholes is usually done with smaller needles. Hold the
work with right side toward you and work from right to left. Insert
right needle into the first st from edge, pick up stitches (Ill. No.
32). When picking up stitches on an irregular edge be sure to pick up a
stitch in every row. Always work with the right side toward you unless
otherwise directed.

                              BUTTONHOLES

Work to the point specified. Bind off three or more stitches according
to directions and work to end of row. In the following row work to the
bound off sts and cast on the same number of stitches bound off in
previous row and complete row. (Ill. No. 33 and 34).

                              WEAVING TOE

Cut yarn leaving about a 14 inch length, thread this into a darning
needle, * insert needle through first st of first needle as if knitting
and slip stitch off needle, pass through next stitch as if purling and
leave stitch on needle, draw yarn through first st of back needle as if
purling and slip stitch off needle, draw yarn through next stitch of
back needle as if knitting and leave stitch on needle, repeat from *
until all stitches have been worked, fasten neatly.

                            DUPLICATE STITCH

This is the stitch used most often for embroidering a desired motif on a
knitted article. It is worked by: * bringing needle through center of
stitch from the wrong side to right side of work—see ill. A. Following
the outline of the knit stitch above, draw the yarn across the back of
the two strands of this stitch—see ill. A and B—return needle to the
center of the same stitch—see ill. B—and draw yarn through. Repeat from
* starting next stitch by bringing needle through center of stitch to be
duplicated—see ill. C.

                          CHANGING COLORS....

At the end of a row, tie in new color and continue in pattern. In
Scandinavian, Fair Isle or Ski patterns the additional colors are
carried on the wrong side of work. Designs of this type are usually
worked from a chart with a color code. When changing colors always twist
yarns around each other to prevent a hole. If color is carried over more
than 4 sts, the carried color should be twisted around the yarn that is
being worked to prevent loose lengths on wrong side. Twist the yarn in
following manner; pick up carried color, before knitting st in usual
manner twist over yarn that is carried. Cut colors only when you are
through with that color leaving about a 4 or 5 inch length to be
fastened later with a yarn sewing needle. If designs to be worked are
separated or only 1 design is worked in a corner of garment, use bobbins
(see page 6) to work design.


                          GENERAL INFORMATION

Directions are given for Ladies small (size 12, Bust 32). Changes for
Ladies’ Medium (Size 14, Bust 34) and Large (Size 16, Bust 36) are given
in parentheses. Men’s small (Size and Chest 38), Medium (Size and Chest
40) and Large (Size and Chest 42) are given in bold face type.


                             CHANGING SIZES

NOTE: When working with pattern sts ADD or SUBTRACT the multiple of sts
or repeats necessary to work one inch of gauge for size desired.

LARGER: (1) For each size larger than given, ADD the number of sts
called for in GAUGE to make 1 inch to both back and front cast on sts.

(2) Continue to follow directions given to armhole shaping or desired
length to armhole. Bind off 2 sts more for each size larger. Work ¼ inch
more in length.

(3) SHAPE SHOULDERS: Bind off 2 sts more each shoulder for each size
larger.

(4) SLEEVES: Add 2 sts more in cuff, then 2 sts more in last row of
ribbing. Bind off 2 sts more each side at underarm.

SMALLER: (1) For each size smaller than size given, SUBTRACT the number
of sts called for in GAUGE equal to 1 inch from both front and back cast
on sts.

(2) Continue to follow directions to armhole shaping or desired length
to armhole. Bind off 2 sts less for each size smaller. Work ¼ inch less
in length for each size smaller.

(3) SHAPE SHOULDERS: Bind off 2 sts less for each size smaller.

(4) SLEEVES: Subtract 4 sts at cuff and bind off 2 sts less each side at
underarm.


                       CHILD’S or IN-BETWEEN SIZE

If child’s garment is desired or if you are not a regular size, work as
follows:

(1) Take chest or bust measure. Divide the figure in half (half is
front, half is back).

(2) Multiply this figure (the half of chest measure) by sts (or rows)
necessary to equal gauge.

(3) Follow directions given, working back and front to desired length to
underarm. Work armhole shaping in proportion to directions given. Work
armhole desired length. Shape shoulder proportionately to directions
being followed. Work sleeves in proportion to added or subtracted sts.

(4) Always have same number of rows on back and front of sweater. Work
same amount of rows for both sleeves.


                         BLOCKING AND FINISHING

Blocking is method used to shape a garment for a “professional look”.
Steps to follow:

1—Conceal all ends: run ends through several stitches on wrong side. If
yarn is heavy or bulky, split strand and run ends through several
stitches.

2—Determine whether garment is to be washed. If so, wash each section
separately by hand or machine wash garment according to specific
instructions on yarn label or commercial laundering product. Most
garments stretch larger when wet. Care, therefore, should be taken in
handling wet sections. Squeeze gently in the washing, DO NOT TWIST or
WRING. Rinse thoroughly. Place in turkish towel and squeeze out excess
moisture. Place on turkish towel to dry. If sections of garment appear
to be too big, adjust sections to measure by pushing sections into
slight puckers. Puckers will disappear when sections dry.

3—Always use the stitch gauge given as a guide for blocking.
Instructions are written for the average in any size, see page 14 for
our sizes. Any slight adjustment for individual size should be made in
the blocking.

4—After measurements have been determined, place the sections
individually and wrong side up on a well padded surface or table. It is
sometimes helpful to draw outline on brown paper or heavy tissue paper.
With rust proof pins, pin each section to measurement spacing pins about
½ inch apart.

5—Place a wet pressing cloth over a section. Using a rotary motion, hold
iron as close as possible to section allowing steam to penetrate, but DO
NOT at any time let iron rest on garment. Leave sections on pressing
table until thoroughly dry.... Do not hurry this process.

6—Always bear in mind that cables and rib patterns have a tendency to
pull in or shrink back. Each section should be blocked about 2 inches
more than desired measure, but should NEVER be pressed flat. Also some
patterns are especially designed for a textured effect. They too should
NEVER be pressed flat. Never press ribbing of cuffs, waistband or
neckline.

    [Illustration: {unlabelled}]

7—After all sections have been blocked garment is now ready for
finishing. Seams may be woven (see illustrations for weaving lengthwise
and crosswise seams) or back stitched (see illustration page 31), or by
sewing machine. To weave lengthwise seam: thread tapestry needle with a
single strand of matching yarn. Hold lengthwise edges together, right
sides up. Insert needle in center of st on right side, pass under two
rows and pull yarn through to right side. Insert needle in corresponding
row of left side, draw yarn through in same way. Work from side to side
in this manner taking care to keep seam elastic, matching rows,
patterns, stripes, etc. To weave a crosswise seam: hold crosswise edges
together. Starting at right edge, insert needle under two loops of
stitch on top section, insert needle down through center of next stitch
and up through center of next stitch on lower section. Continue in same
manner working alternately into top section and then into lower section
until seam is completed taking care to keep seam elastic and matching
patterns, etc.

b—Back stitching: place right sides of sections to be seamed together.
Pin, keeping edges even and matching rows or patterns. With tapestry
needle and matching yarn back stitch close to edge taking care not to
draw stitches too tight and keeping seam elastic.

    [Illustration: {unlabelled}]

c—Sewing machine: loosen tension on machine as you would for jersey or
any stretchy fabric. Place right sides together and pin. Baste seam
being careful not to draw stitches too tight. Remove pins. With matching
thread machine stitch seam. If yarn is bulky or fuzzy sew over tissue
paper. Remove paper when finished.

8—After garment is all assembled, carefully steam seams flat and even.


                             TO SHORTEN ...

(No hem desired). Determine length you desire; place a marker. Cut
through one st at side seam about 2 rows below marker. * Pick up cut end
and draw through several sts, cut this length close as possible to work.
This drawn length will tighten sts. After length has been cut straighten
edge taking care with loose sts. Place loose sts on free needle. Repeat
from * until row has been ripped and sts have been placed on needle.
With free needle bind off—or—attach yarn on P side, and with crochet
hook work a slip stitch (see page 30) in each st, turn. Work a slip
stitch in each st, cut yarn. If a hem is desired, allow for hem and
complete same as above. Turn hem to wrong side and tack in place.


                            TO LENGTHEN ...

(If a sufficient amount of same dye lot is available). Cut off cast on
edge in same manner as above. Pick up loose sts and knit to length
desired. If there is a ribbing on section to be lengthened, cut into the
row above the ribbing, then add to length. If you do not have enough of
same dye lot to work garment to length desired, we suggest working a
stripe of contrasting color and finishing with same color as garment.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
